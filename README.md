## Key Learnings
An attempt at project-base learning, this was the first in a series of simple projects to help me revive some coding skills.
Simply making this page responsive took a week (on top of a full-time job) as I needed to relearn basics like CSS grid and Flex Box.

(It's amazing how rusty you get not coding for a good part of the year!)

- CSS naming conventions ([BEM](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/css-naming-conventions-that-will-save-you-hours-of-debugging-35cea737d849/))
- Carousels aren't always good UX ([read more](https://cxl.com/blog/dont-use-automatic-image-sliders-or-carousels/))
- Defining custom colors
- Creating a carousel from scratch
- Creating a responsive navbar
- Hosting on Firebase
